</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds skirt, flank, sirloin, or hanger steak sliced into ½ inch strips</li>
    <li>1 red pepper deseeded and sliced into thin strips</li>
    <li>1 green or yellow pepper deseeded and sliced into thin strips</li>
    <li>1 medium onion peeled and sliced into thin strips</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
    <li>6-8 tortillas warmed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place the steak into a sealable bag. Place the peppers and onion into a separate sealable bag. Add the olive oil, lime juice, chili powder, ground cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, and garlic to a jar with a screw top or tight fitting lid. Shake until well combined. Pour ⅓ of the marinade over steak, ⅓ of marinade over vegetables and reserve the remaining marinade in the jar for using when cooking the steak fajitas. Seal the bags tightly and refrigerate for one hour to overnight.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour the vegetables into the skillet and cook until just tender crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet to a plate and add steak strips to the same skillet. When the steak is cooked throughout (about 7-10 minutes), add vegetables back to the skillet along with the reserved marinade.</li>
    <li>Serve with warm tortillas and desired optional garnishes.</li>
