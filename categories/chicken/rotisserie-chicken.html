    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 (3 pound) whole chicken
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch salt
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ cup butter, melted
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon paprika
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ tablespoon ground black pepper
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Season the inside of the chicken with a pinch of salt. Place the chicken onto a rotisserie and set the grill on high. Cook for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            During that time, quickly mix together the butter, 1 tablespoon of salt, paprika and pepper. Turn the grill down to medium and baste the chicken with the butter mixture. Close the lid and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, basting occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (83 degrees C) when taken in the thigh with a meat thermometer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the rotisserie and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting into pieces and serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
