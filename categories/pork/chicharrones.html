<em>Homemade chicharrones, or pork rinds, are a healthy and flavorful low carb snack without the additives or hydrogenated oils. The ultimate keto and paleo snack!</em>
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 to 5 lbs pork back fat and skin</li>
    <li>Extra cooking oil or lard if needed</li>
    <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
    <li>Pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 250F and set a wire rack over a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Using a very sharp knife, cut pork skin and fat into long strips, about 2 inches wide. Score the fat on each strip every two inches. Insert knife carefully between skin and fat on one end of the strip and remove a portion of the fat (you will end up with a thin layer of fat still on the skin and that is fine).</li>
    <li>Once that first part of fat is removed, you can hold the skin in one hand as you slide the knife down the strip to remove the majority of the fat. Again, a little fat still clinging to the skin is okay.</li>
    <li>When the fat has been removed, cut each strip into 2 inch squares and place, fat-side down, on wire rack.</li>
    <li>Bake 3 hours, until skin is completely dried out.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, if you want to use the pork fat to cook your chicharrones, place it in a large saucepan over medium low heat. Cook gently until most of the fat has liquified, about 2 hours. This is also the same way you can render lard for future cooking use. Use a slotted spoon to remove any remaining solids. Discard (or eat, they taste like bacon and are great on salad!).</li>
    <li>When baking time is up, heat oil/lard to a depth of â…“ in the pan. Or you can just have a few inches of oil and can cook your pork rinds in batches. Oil should be quite hot but not bubbling.</li>
    <li>Add pork rinds and cook until they bubble and puff up, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle immediately with salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>
