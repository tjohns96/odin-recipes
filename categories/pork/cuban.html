</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>For the roast pork</h3>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
    <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
    <h3>For the cuban sandwich</h3>
    <li>4 (8-to-10-inch) Cuban sandwich loaves, halved lengthwise</li>
    <li>1 stick unsalted butter, softened and divided</li>
    <li>1 cup yellow mustard</li>
    <li>1 pound sliced honey-glazed ham</li>
    <li>4 large dill pickles, thinly sliced crosswise</li>
    <li>Roast pork</li>
    <li>8 ounces (16 each) Swiss cheese slices</li>
    <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the roast pork: Preheat the oven to 450 F, and line a sheet pan with foil. In a mini food processor, combine all of the pork ingredients, except for the tenderloin, and purée until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the tenderloin, tossing to coat. Cover in plastic and let marinate on the counter for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the tenderloin to the prepared sheet pan and pour the marinade over top. Roast until the pork has reached an internal temperature of 140° on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes, then carve into ¼-inch slices on a bias.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the sandwiches: Rub the outer side of the top and bottom of each loaf with 1 tablespoon of the softened butter and arrange, butter-side down, on a cutting board. Spread 2 tablespoons of yellow mustard on the inside of each piece of bread. On the bottom half of each loaf, layer a quarter of the ham, followed by a quarter each of the pickle slices, roast pork and cheese. Season with a pinch of salt and close with the top half of the bread. Repeat with the remaining loaves and fixings.</li>
    <li>Heat up a panini maker according to the directions. Then, working in batches, press the sandwiches until golden brown and the cheese has melted, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a board and cut each one in half on a bias, then serve.</li>
